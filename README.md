<h1>Valve Controller</h1>

<p>Current PCB Revision: 1.0</p>
<p>PCB Part Number: L0005</p>

<p>The Valve Controller PCB contains the hardware responsible for controlling the actuation of the liquid engine's solenoids and servo-actuated ball valves. The controller contains an ARM Cortex-M microcontroller, solid state relays for solenoid actuation, a 3.3V power supply, and a UART interface for communicating with the main engine controller (L0002)</p>
